First Steps
------

1. Clone this repository into your themes directory.
1. Rename the directory's name to your own project name.
1. Open `style.css` and edit the text to fit your own project.
1. Change the screenshot.png to your own projects screenshot.
1. Replace the images in `assets/img/` with your own.

Setup Development Environment
------

Dummy uses LESS for styling your website. All LESS files can be found in `assets/less`.
You need to setup a LESS compiler to compile `assets/less/styles.less` to `assets/css/styles.css`.

If you are using Codekit just add the `assets` directory to it. This directory includes a `codekit-config.json` file, which tells Codekit how to handle the LESS files.
